## Submitted File
- `A2.c`

## Compile and Run
- Compile: `gcc -pthread A2.c -o A2`
- Run: `./A2 5`

## Output: 
```
TA is sleeping.
Student 1 is programming for 1 second.
Student 1 wakes up the TA and gets immediate help.
TA starts helping student 1 immediately.
TA is helping student 1 for 2 seconds.
Student 2 sits in chair 0.
Student 2 is waiting. Total waiting: 1
Student 3 sits in chair 1.
Student 3 is waiting. Total waiting: 2
TA finished helping student 1.
TA calls student 2. Waiting students left: 1
Student 2 goes into the office for help.
TA is helping student 2 for 1 second.
Student 4 sits in chair 2.

## Program Features
- **A. Setup**
  - **a1.** Read number of students from command line
  - **a2.** Initialize shared variables
  - **a3.** Initialize mutex and semaphores
  - **a4.** Allocate arrays for threads, ids, semaphores

- **B. Create Threads**
  - **b1.** Create 1 TA thread
  - **b2.** Create `n` student threads
  - **b3.** Give each student a unique id

- **C. Runtime Logic**
  - **c1.** Student programs for random time
  - **c2.** Student asks TA for help
  - **c3.** If a chair is available, the student waits
  - **c4.** If no chair is available, the student comes back later
  - **c5.** If the TA is sleeping, the student wakes the TA
  - **c6.** TA helps one student at a time
  - **c7.** TA sleeps again if nobody is waiting

- **D. Synchronization**
  - **d1.** Mutex protects shared data
  - **d2.** `students_waiting` wakes the TA
  - **d3.** `student_called[i]` calls one student
  - **d4.** `student_done[i]` tells the student help is done
